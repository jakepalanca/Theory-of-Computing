Alphabet:
    * A finite and nonempty set of symbols
    * Has to be nonempty and finite
    * Often represented by capital Σ

String:
    * Mathematically, it is a sequence (ordered)
    * Characters can be repeated (NOT A SET)
    * A string, in theory, could be infinite
    * When thinking of strings as input, we typically think of them as finite
    * For example, “A” is a string over the English Alphabet

Empty String:
    * Denoted by symbol ε
    * ε is a constant
    * Length is always zero
    * ε is a string over any and all Σ
    * ε is not a symbol in any alphabet, it is a string

Language over Σ:
    * A set of finite Strings over Σ
    * Can use any set theory operations
    * L compliment is equal to Σ* - L
    * Σ* compliment is ε (EMPTY SET)

Σ*:
    * Defined recursively
    * String length is finite
    * unique since its moving further away from the base step!
    * Computes a set
    * Σ* set is infinitely large since finite input Strings are unbounded
